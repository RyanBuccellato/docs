# Introducing Warehouse Connectors: Sync event data from Snowflake & BigQuery into Mixpanel

Today, all customers have access to Warehouse Connectors, which allows you to natively import data from Snowflake or BigQuery into Mixpanel. With this feature, you can set up recurring syncs from your data warehouse and ensure that Mixpanel is always in sync with your trusted data.

This native connection not only simplifies event implementation since you no longer need engineering resources to manually track events, but it also makes it easier to analyze all types of company data in Mixpanel and gain a holistic view of your customers.

For example, you can bring into Mixpanel:

- **AppDB tables**: Signups, Reports Created, Dashboards Created
- **Salesforce data**: Opportunity Created, Account Created, Account Upsell
- **Support data**: Ticket Created, Ticket Resolved
- **Billing/Consumption data:** Ad Spend, Units Consumed, etc.
- **Clickstream data from Snowplow:** Views, clicks, etc

And answer questions that are:

- **Revenue-related:** What is % of sales opportunities do we win? What is the average deal size in North America?
- **Business impact-related:** Which campaigns account for the most revenue? What is the breakdown of the ARR of customers that use this feature?
- **Support-related:** What is our average time to resolve a ticket?
