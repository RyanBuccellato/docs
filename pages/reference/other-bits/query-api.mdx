# Query API

<CustomCallout type="info">
  To see this API in action, visit our [API Playground](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/insights-query).
</CustomCallout>


## Overview
The Query API allows you to obtain the same calculated and formatted results that you see from a report in our web app.

The query endpoints should serve as the starting point for exporting user information from Mixpanel. This is done through the /engage endpoint. See the Export section for information on exporting event data.

The Mixpanel Query API endpoints can:

- Filter or break down Events
- Return user profiles.
- Return an activity/event stream for a user.
- Return a cohort of users.
- And more!


## Authentication

### Service Account
[Service Account Authentication Details](/reference/other-bits/authentication#service-accounts)
<CustomCallout type="success">
  This is the preferred authentication method for Query API."
</CustomCallout>

- Requests parameters must include a `project_id`. 

**Projects with [Data Views](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043782572-Data-Views)**
- In addition to `project_id`, you should include the global data view's `workspace_id` as a request parameter.

**Projects with [Classified Data](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044295131-Data-Classification)**
- Your results may be filtered based on the Service Account's sensitivity settings.

### Project Secret

<CustomCallout type="warning" title="Please migrate existing integrations to use Service Account authentication">
  Project Secret authentication is in the process of being deprecated. This authentication method does not currently have an EOL date.
</CustomCallout>


## Insights

### Query Saved Report
Get data from your Insights reports.

```sh
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://mixpanel.com/api/query/insights?project_id={PROJECT_ID}&bookmark_id={BOOKMARK_ID}' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```
## Funnels

### Query Saved Report
Get data for a funnel.

```sh
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://mixpanel.com/api/query/funnels?project_id={PROJECT_ID}&funnel_id={FUNNEL_ID}&from_date=2023-08-20&to_date=2023-09-20' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```
### List Saved Funnels
Get the names and funnel_ids of your funnels.

```sh
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://mixpanel.com/api/query/funnels/list?project_id={PROJECT_ID}' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```
## Retention

### Query Retention Report
Get cohort analysis.

If you specify neither an `interval` nor a `unit`, the `interval` is 1 day. This means that each user gets 24 hours in each interval to do the specified event.\n\nAn example response with a `born_event` of 'event integration' and `event` of 'viewed report' might look like this:
```json
    {
        "2012-01-01": {
            "counts": [2, 1, 2], "first": 2
        },
        "2012-01-02": {
            "counts": [9, 7, 6], "first": 10
        },
        "2012-01-03": {
            "counts": [9, 6, 4], "first": 10
        }
    }
```

These results indicate that on 2012-01-02, 10 users did the `born_event` (\"event integration\"), as indicated by the first field. If the `retention_type=compounded`, then first will instead indicate the number of users who did `event` (\"viewed report\") on the specified date. 9 of those users did `event` (\"viewed report\") within 24 hours (the \"0th\" interval) of doing the `born_event`. Seven of those did `event` between 24 and 48 hours (interval 1) of the `born_event`. These 7 are a subset of the initial 10, but not necessarily a subset of the 9 (retention is not a funnel; see the number increase between 72 and 96 hours). And finally, 6 users did `event` between 48 and 72 hours (interval 2) after the `born_event`.

In the Mixpanel retention UI, \"First time\" corresponds to `retention_type=birth`, and \"Recurring\" corresponds to `retention_type=compounded`.

```sh
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://mixpanel.com/api/query/retention?project_id={PROJECT_ID}&from_date=2023-08-20&to_date=2023-09-20&born_event=Added%20to%20cart&event=Viewed%20report&born_where=properties%5B%22%24os%22%5D%3D%3D%22Linux%22&where=properties%5B%22%24os%22%5D%3D%3D%22Linux%22&unbounded_retention=false' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```
### Query Frequency Report
Get data about how frequently users are performing events.\n\nLet's breakdown an example response. If you specify `day` as \"unit\" and `hour` as \"addiction_unit\", you will get a response that looks like this:

```json
    {
        "2012-01-01": [305, 107, 60, 41, 32, 20, 12, 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
        "2012-01-02": [495, 204, 117, 77, 53, 36, 26, 20, 12, 7, 4, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        "2012-01-03": [671, 324, 176, 122, 81, 63, 48, 31, 21, 14, 9, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    }
```

One day's worth of data is shown for each date, split into hours. On 2012-01-02, 495 users did the event `Viewed report` during at least 1 hour out of the next 24 hour period (the period specified by `unit`). 204 users did the event during at least 2 hours. 117 users did the event during at least 3 hours.

```sh
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://mixpanel.com/api/query/retention/addiction?project_id={PROJECT_ID}&from_date=2023-08-20&to_date=2023-09-20&unit=day&addiction_unit=hour' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

## JQL

### Custom JQL Query
The HTTP API is the lowest-level way to use JQL. At its core, the API is very simple: you write a script, and you post it to an API endpoint with some authentication parameters.

For longer scripts, you will likely want to keep the code in a file. If you had your script in a file called my_query.js, you could run it using the following cURL command:

```sh
curl https://mixpanel.com/api/query/jql \
     -u YOUR_API_SECRET: \
     --data-urlencode script@my_query.js
```

Example curl with the script directly inside of the curl:
```sh
curl --request POST \
     --url https://mixpanel.com/api/query/jql \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
     --data 'script=function main(){
  return Events(params)
    .groupBy(
      ["name"],
      mixpanel.reducer.count()
    )
}
' \
     --data 'params={
  "scriptParam": "paramValue"
}
'
```

Note
- Queries will timeout after 2 minutes of run-time.
- You cannot make remote network requests (using XMLHttpRequest) from JavaScript.
