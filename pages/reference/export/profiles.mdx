# Profile Export

<CustomCallout type="info">
  To see this API in action, visit our [API Playground](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/engage-query).
</CustomCallout>

The Engage API lets you export User Profiles based on a set of criteria.

## Authentication

### Service Account
[Service Account Authentication Details](/reference/other-bits/authentication#service-accounts)
<CustomCallout type="success">
  This is the preferred authentication method for Query API.
</CustomCallout>

- Requests parameters must include a `project_id`. 

**Projects with [Data Views](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043782572-Data-Views)**
- In addition to `project_id`, you should include the global data view's `workspace_id` as a request parameter.

**Projects with [Classified Data](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044295131-Data-Classification)**
- Your results may be filtered based on the Service Account's sensitivity settings.

### Project Secret

<CustomCallout type="warning" title="Please migrate existing integrations to use Service Account authentication">
  Project Secret authentication is in the process of being deprecated. This authentication method does not currently have an EOL date.
</CustomCallout>


## Usage
TODO: Show both a cURL + adapt below to be a more complete example in Python.

API responses will return at most `page_size` records for each request. To request additional records, callers should repeat their call to the api using the same `where` param, but provide a `session_id` parameter with a value taken from the first response, and include a `page` parameter with a value one greater than the value of page in the response.

A caller trying to retrieve all of the records for a particular query might use an algorithm something like this:

```javascript
// Get the first page of data associated with our selector expression
this_page = query_api(where=YOUR_SELECTOR_EXPRESSION)
do_something_with_response(this_page)

// If we get fewer records than the page_sized returned with our results,
// then there are no more records to get. Otherwise, keep querying for additional pages.
while (length of this_page.results) >= this_page.page_size:
    next_page_number = this_page.page + 1
    this_page = query_api(where=YOUR_SELECTOR_EXPRESSION, session_id=this_page.session_id, page=next_page_number)
    do_something_with_response(this_page)
```

Here's a curl example of this API:

```sh
curl --request POST \
     --url https://mixpanel.com/api/query/engage \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
```


## Filtering
You can filter the set of profiles by either specifying a `$distinct_id` or by specifying the ID of a [cohort](/docs/analysis/advanced/cohort) you've defined in our UI.

curl example filtering down by properties.

TODO: should we bother adding the "selector expression" based filtering back to this? Technically you can do that by providing a cohort ID without having to learn our selector language... probably a net better UX.
