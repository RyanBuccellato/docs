# Event Export

<CustomCallout type="info">
  To see this API in action, visit our [API Playground](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/raw-event-export).
</CustomCallout>

The Mixpanel Export Data APIs allow you to export your events as JSON either manually or on a schedule.

Example usage:

- If you receive a spike of 10K events but notice that only a few users contributed to it and would like to compare the data to another source.
- If you are exporting events from one project and importing them into another.
- If you are doing some very custom analysis Mixpanel cannot currently do. If this is the case, please [contact support](https://mixpanel.com/get-support) so we can either improve our product or possibly show you how you can perform this analysis within Mixpanel.

Note: if you want to continuously export to a cloud storage bucket or data warehouse,  we recommend using our [Data Pipelines](/docs/other-bits/data-pipelines) add-on, which is more scalable and automatically managed.

## Authentication

### Service Account
[Service Account Authentication Details](/reference/other-bits/authentication#service-accounts)
<CustomCallout type="success">
  This is the preferred authentication method for Query API."
</CustomCallout>

- Requests parameters must include a `project_id`. 

**Projects with [Data Views](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043782572-Data-Views)**
- In addition to `project_id`, you should include the global data view's `workspace_id` as a request parameter.

**Projects with [Classified Data](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044295131-Data-Classification)**
- Your results may be filtered based on the Service Account's sensitivity settings.

### Project Secret

<CustomCallout type="warning" title="Please migrate existing integrations to use Service Account authentication">
  Project Secret authentication is in the process of being deprecated. This authentication method does not currently have an EOL date.
</CustomCallout>


## Download Data

Every data point sent to Mixpanel is stored as JSON in our data store. The raw export API allows you to download your event data as it is received and stored within Mixpanel, complete with all event properties (including distinct_id) and the exact timestamp the event was fired.

Here's a curl example of this API:

```sh
curl --request GET \
     --url https://data.mixpanel.com/api/2.0/export \
     --header 'accept: text/plain'
```
